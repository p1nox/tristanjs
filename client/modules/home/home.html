  * The idea here is to create some remote data, so go to <b>"Remote Data"</b> section.
</p>

<p>
  * There you will find two boxes, one for the <b>path</b> and the other for the actual <b>data</b>.
</p>

<p>
  * When you hit "Create", it will save the data associated with the path, so you will be able to get your JSON data requesting for <a href="#">/api/endpoints/:user_id:path.json</a>
